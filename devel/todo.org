* NMsim todo

** general

*** DONE Setting for paths to executables
Path to nonmem, psn, other ways to exec.

*** DONE Fork NMwriteSection from NMdata
** NMsim
*** DONE Create simulations dir if create.dir=TRUE
If not, throw error if dir.sim does not exist
*** DONE Support non-data.table workflows
**** DONE use NMdata's as.fun
*** DONE Rename type.input to type.mod
*** TODO Revise input data paths
Currently, NMsimData... goes together with NMsim....  It would be
better for svn if the first part of the filenames were aligned. Also,
do we need to archive input data as _input as well in this case?
*** TODO Test if control stream exists
Currently, the error comes from NMextractDataFile which is not
intuitive to the user.
*** DONE support multiple models
*** DONE arg for transformation of sim results
*** DONE Arg to control whether simulation is run
sometimes one may want to do a different simulation than the
standard - say with PSN sse. In that case one still want the sim to be
configured but not run.
*** DONE Support abbreviations
$COV $COVARIANCE $EST $ESTIMATION $SIM $SIMULATION

Maybe this should be done in NMwriteSection/NMreadSection instead.
*** DONE Support using a ready-made sim model
No modifications needed to control stream except $INPUT and $TABLE
*** TODO Improve reuse.results
to method to compare all arguments to what's on file
*** DONE Support multiple $TABLE blocks
** NMcreateDoses
*** TODO II/ADDL should only be applied to last event.
addl.lastonly argument?
*** DONE TIME must be full length
*** TODO No NA's should be allowed anywhere? Or?
*** TODO if a cov is found in multiple arguments, it must span same values

*** DONE Should CMT have a default? Or be required?
For now, required

*** TODO avoid hard coding variable names

*** TODO N is another arg 
If ID not in covs, everything is replicated. It can be a data.table
too, meaning that we replicate within covariates. Maybe we have to be
able to use a known set of ID's and covs? Or use ID?
@param ID ID's to replicate for. Default is 1. Use NULL to omit.

** addEVID2
*** TODO Order the same way as NMdata::addTAPD?
currently, addEVID2 does not order rows after adding simulation records
