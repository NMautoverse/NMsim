*** model
to only contain "xgxr021", like the "model" column from NMscanData().

model must be unique. if file.mod contains multiple models with same name, they must be numbered.

file.mod=c(mod1="path1/q.mod",mod2="path2/q.mod")
*** name.sim
The value provided in the "name.sim" argument, defaulting to
'default', as in the example above. This is the old "sim" column.

This is useful if one model is
simulated in two NMsim() calls and results are stacked (like
?bootstrap? and ?NWPRI?).

*** model.sim 
to contain the contents of the old `model` column. So
model+name.sim+numbering
