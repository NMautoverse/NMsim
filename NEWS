# 0.0.5
## New features

* The simulation method called NMsim_known now accepts other .phi
  files to use than the .phi file generated by the estimation
  run. This is useful if one wants to reuse subjects generated in a
  previous simulation.

## Other/minor improvements

* NMexec now also copies out the shk (shrinkage estimates) file after
  a run. The files that will by default be copied and reported next to
  the control streams are now xml, ext, cov, cor, coi, phi, shk - in
  addition to output table files and the archived input data of
  course.

# 0.0.2
## New features

* NMsim supports type.sim="typical" which means all OMEGAS will be
  fixed to zero. This requires the ext file to be present.

* Experimental support for simulation of estimated subjects using type.sim="known".
